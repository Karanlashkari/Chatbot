# Chatbot
This repository hosts a Python script for an AI-powered chat bot that utilizes OpenAI's text generation API to engage in conversational interactions with users. The chat bot operates within a simple text-based interface, where users can input messages and receive responses generated by the AI model.

# Key Features:
OpenAI Integration: Leverages OpenAI's text generation capabilities.
Interactive Interface: Engage with the bot through a user-friendly text interface.
Prompt-Response Mechanism: Generates replies based on user input.
Error Handling: Robust mechanisms to manage exceptions and errors.
Customizable: Fine-tune parameters for specific use cases.
Easy Integration: Seamlessly integrate into existing projects or deploy as standalone.

# Functions:
get_api_response(prompt: str) -> Union[str, None]: Queries OpenAI API to generate a response based on the given prompt.
update_list(message: str, pl: List[str]): Appends a message to the prompt list used for generating prompts.
create_prompt(message: str, pl: List[str]) -> str: Creates a prompt by concatenating messages in the prompt list.
get_bot_response(message: str, pl: List[str]) -> str: Generates a response from the chat bot based on the user's message and the current conversation context.

# Usage:
Developers can utilize this codebase as a foundation for creating innovative conversational experiences and exploring the capabilities of natural language processing technologies..
